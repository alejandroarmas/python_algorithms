# Algorithms

Here is an assortment of various algorithm implementations I have made in anticipation of software engineering internships, feel free to reuse my code however you please. 


## How to Use

```python
from datastructures import Graph

graph = Graph(V, E) # Where V and E are defined  

```

## Testing 

Example of testing our graph algorithms

```console 
	python -m unittest tests/datastructures/test_graph.py	
```

If you would like to know which functionality is being tested, use the `-v` flag.
 
```console
 	python -m unittest -v tests/divideAndConquor/test_sortedMatrixSearch.py

```
